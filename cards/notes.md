# Notes

## slices

- 0 indexed, like arrays
- fruits [apple, banana, grape, orange]
fruits[startIndexIncluding : upToNotIncluding]
fruits[0:2] = ["apple" "banana"]
fruits[:2] = ["apple" "banana"]
fruits[2:] = ["grape" "orange"]

## type conversion

we want | we have

[]byte("Hi There")

## go testing

1. I like go testing!
2. Very simple, file names need to end in _test.go
3. go test runs them
4. use simple go commands / syntax to write tests.
